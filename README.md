# Carosello Array di Oggetti

In this project an array of objects is used to feed data to an image carousel.

1. Create an array of objects containing URLs, titles, and descriptions.  
2. Use the newly created array to populate the carousel. Make the text boxes change together with the images and thumbnails when clicking the arrows.  
3. Add a button that inverts the autoplay direction.
